## Next Steps

1. **Create Pull Requests**: Use the provided URLs to create pull requests for each feature branch
2. **Review Process**: Review each branch individually or as part of comprehensive v0.2.0 release
3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests on each branch before merging
4. **Documentation**: Update any additional documentation as needed
5. **Release**: Plan v0.2.0 release after all branches are merged

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Modular Development**: Each feature can be developed and reviewed independently
2. **Clear History**: Detailed commit messages provide clear change history
3. **Easy Rollback**: Individual features can be rolled back if needed
4. **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
5. **Professional Standards**: Follows Git best practices and conventional commits
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each change is thoroughly documented
